# What Is HTTP?

HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is the basic system that allows web browsers and web servers to communicate. Whenever you load a website your browser will send an HTTP request and the server will then send back an HTTP response.

## Why HTTP Exists
Computers need a standard method to communicate on the internet. HTTP is this standard method. It defines how messages are sent, received, and even interpreted between a client and a server.

## Key Features of HTTP
- Its stateless, meaning each request is independent.
- Its simple to use and understand.
- Its flexible, meaning it can transfer many types of content.
- Finally, its extensible. Meaning that users can update to newer versions like HTTPS add security.
