# What Is HTTP?

HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is the basic system that allows web browsers and web servers to communicate. When you load a website, your browser sends an HTTP request and the server sends back an HTTP response.

## Why HTTP Exists
Computers need a standard method to communicate on the internet. HTTP defines how messages are sent, received, and interpreted between a client and a server.

## Key Features of HTTP
- Stateless: Each request is independent.
- Simple to use and understand.
- Flexible: Can transfer many types of content.
- Extensible: Newer versions like HTTPS add security.
