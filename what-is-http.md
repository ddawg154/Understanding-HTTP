# What Is HTTP?

HTTP stands for **Hypertext Transfer Protocol**. It is the foundational system that allows web browsers and web servers to communicate. Anytime you visit a website, watch a video, open social media, or load an online game, HTTP is being used behind the scenes.

At its core, HTTP is a **request–response protocol**. This means:

1. Your browser sends a request.
2. A web server sends back a response.

Because of how lightweight and simple it is, HTTP became the standard method for transferring information on the web.

## Why HTTP Exists

Computers on the internet need a shared way to talk to each other. Early developers created HTTP to make it easy for clients (browsers) and servers to send text, images, and files in a consistent format.

HTTP defines:
- how messages are formatted  
- how messages are transmitted  
- how the server and browser should react to each type of message

## Key Features of HTTP

- **Stateless:** The protocol does not remember past requests. Each request is treated independently.
- **Flexible:** Can transfer many types of data (HTML, CSS, JSON, images, etc.)
- **Simple:** Easy for developers to understand and use.
- **Extensible:** Modern additions like HTTPS and HTTP/2 make it faster and more secure.
